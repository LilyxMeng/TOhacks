        <h1>COINSPIRE</h1>
        <h6>Graphic Art Just Got Better!</h6>
        <br>

        <p>COINSPIRE is a collaborative place where users from around the world can contribute a single pixel that
          will end up being a graphic art!</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>COINSPIRE is a collaborative place where users from around the world can contribute a single pixel that will collaboratively build up into elaborate graphic art! With a timeout of 1 second, users cannot get very far working on their own, and are forced to collaborate to take over the board.

        <h3>What It Does</h3>
        <p>COINSPIRE is a collaborative place where users from around the world can contribute a single pixel that will collaboratively build up into elaborate graphic art! With a timeout of 1 second, users cannot get very far working on their own, and are forced to collaborate to take over the board. </p>

        <h3>How We Built It</h3>
        <p>We built COINSPIRE with HTML, CSS with bootstrap, and JavaScript for our frontend, Node.js for our backend, socket.io for webhooks and real-time client-server communication, and SQL with Cockroach db for our database to store all data received to transmit updates in live time to all users. We hosted the website on google cloud services and reserved the coinspire.tech domain on domain.com. </p>

        <h3>Challenges We Ran Into</h3>
        <p>This was our team's first time working with professional database services as well as implementing features such as live time updates. We faced a lot of difficulty reading a writing to our database, as we cannot have duplicate (x, y) coordinates and reserve compute time.</p>

        <h3>Accomplishments We Are Proud Of</h3>
        <p>This was our team's first time working with professional database services as well as implementing features such as live time updates. We faced a lot of difficulty reading and writing to our database, as we cannot have duplicate (x, y) coordinates and reserve compute time.</p>

        <h3>What We Learned</h3>
        <p>We learned how to access and use databases, write SQL, communicate with websockets, host dynamic websites via cloud computing, and work together as a team. Additionally, we have also learned some essential skills like time management skills and collaborating.</p>

        <h3>Whats Next for Coinspire?</h3>
        <p>We plan to expand our project and add more features like converting the canvas to a PNG file and sharing options to make it more interactive. Furthermore, we plan to add collaborative rooms in the server where a group of users can create their own unique art. We are also planning to add more drawing tools, like a paintbrush and such as multiple canvas.</p>

        <h3>How Does Our Project Help?</h3>
        <p>After the covid-19 pandemic, our team was feeling that the world was a bit more bland. We wanted a way for people to come together to create something that would benefit everyone while being a fun and somewhat rewarding experience. We found that the solution to this problem was to build a piece of living art, one that evolves with the people contributing to it. Just like wordle, we envision our platform to be used daily, like an ever-evolving video game that changes with its players. In short, coinspire brings a bit more lemony to peopleâ€™s lives. </p>
